# Data Analytics Projects
This repository contains two data analytics projects that demonstrate my skills in SQL, Python, Power BI, and database design.

Projects:
1. Banking Database Creation
In this project, I designed and implemented a comprehensive banking database consisting of 30 interconnected tables to model various aspects of banking operations. The database includes information on customers, accounts, transactions, loans, and more.

Tools Used: SQL, Python

Key Features:

30 related tables, designed to ensure data consistency

2 million rows inserted using Python

Proper relationships between tables to simulate real banking operations

Optimized for efficient querying and analysis

2. Retail Sales KPI Analysis
This project focused on analyzing retail sales data to uncover key performance indicators (KPIs) using SQL queries. I performed the analysis of top-performing products, sales trends, and revenue distribution directly from the database. The results were then visualized using Power BI for a comprehensive dashboard.

Tools Used: SQL, Power BI

Key Features:

Extracted KPIs through SQL queries, including top products, revenue distribution, and sales trends

Performed detailed analysis of sales performance using SQL

Visualized the results in Power BI to create interactive dashboards for business insights
